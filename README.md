# AccessMap â€“ Accessibility-Aware Navigation System

**A College Project for Smart, Inclusive Routing in Urban Areas**

AccessMap is a smart navigation system developed as part of a college project to provide **sidewalk-based, accessibility-aware routes** for people with mobility challenges. The system is built on open data and custom algorithms to help users avoid steep slopes, stairs, and inaccessible paths, promoting **inclusive urban mobility**.

---

##  Project Objective

To design and implement a map-based routing platform that enables individuals with limited mobility to:

* Avoid steep slopes and missing curb ramps
* Navigate safely using sidewalks instead of vehicle roads
* Customize navigation based on personal mobility constraints

---

##  Key Features

*  **Accessibility-Focused Routing**
  Finds routes using sidewalks, curb cuts, and elevation data.

*  **User Profiles**
  Adjust preferences for slope steepness, stairs, or barriers.

*  **Interactive Map Interface**
  Built using Leaflet.js for real-time path visualization.

*  **Data-Driven Path Planning**
  Utilizes OpenStreetMap and elevation APIs for realistic terrain mapping.
